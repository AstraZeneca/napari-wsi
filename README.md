A plugin to read whole-slide images within [napari].

---

## Installation via pip

You can install `napari-wsi` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install "napari-wsi[all]>=1.0"
```

This automatically installs all optional backends, as a shortcut for:

```bash
pip install "napari-wsi[openslide,rasterio,wsidicom]>=1.0"
```

In addition, to be able to read images using the `openslide` backend, it is
required to install the OpenSlide library itself, for example by installing the
[openslide-bin] python package (also via [pip]).

## Installation via conda

To set up a new [conda] environment for `napari-wsi` that also includes all
optional dependencies, create a new file named `napari-wsi.yml` with the
following content:

```yaml
name: napari-wsi
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - napari-wsi=1.*
  # napari
  - napari
  - pyqt
  # openslide backend
  - openslide>=4.0
  - openslide-python>=1.4
  # rasterio backend
  - rasterio>=1.4
  # wsidicom backend
  - wsidicom>=0.22
```

Then create this environment by running:

```bash
conda env create -f napari-wsi.yml
```

# Description

This [napari] plugin provides a widget for reading various whole-slide image
formats using a common [zarr] store inteface, based on the libraries
[openslide], [rasterio], and [wsidicom].

# Quickstart

After installation, open the `Plugins` menu in the viewer and select
`WSI Reader` to open the widget. Then select a `Backend` to use, select a `Path`
to open, and click `Load`.

If `sRGB` is selected in the `Color Space` menu and an ICC profile is attached
to the given image, a transformation to this color space will be applied when
the image data is read. Otherwise, the raw RGB image data will be displayed.

This plugin can also be used to open image files via drag and drop into the
viewer window. The file suffixes '.bif', '.ndpi', '.scn', '.svs' are registered
with the `openslide` backend, while the suffixes '.tif' and '.tiff' are
registered with the `rasterio` backend. These files can also be opened directly
from the command line or from a python script:

```bash
napari CMU-1.svs
```

```python
from napari.viewer import Viewer

viewer = Viewer()
viewer.open("CMU-1.svs", plugin="napari-wsi")
```
